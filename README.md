# Unity-Shooting-game
The project of my thesis for my bachelor's degree.

It is an educational First Person Shooting game which tries to show that education can be combined with entertainment.

Name of the Game:
Crystal Hunter

Plot: 
The main plot is that the knowledge of Java language has been locked in crystals which had been scattered in different worlds in time.
The player's mission is to discover and collect all the crystals answering the questions that protect them. 

Game consists of 3 stages. Here is a small video from its gameplay in second stage.

P.S.
I didn't upload the code because it is a part of my thesis.
